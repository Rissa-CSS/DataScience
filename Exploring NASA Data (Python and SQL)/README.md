# Exploring NASA Astronaut Data

## Description
**Skill: Data Analysis, SQL, Jupyter Notebook(Python)**
This project involves a comprehensive exploration of NASA Astronaut data. Initially, we will meticulously scrutinize and cleanse the dataset to ensure its integrity. Subsequently, we will export the refined data to a CSV file, which will then be seamlessly integrated into a database. Once the database connection is established, we will employ SQL queries to extract essential information. A few examples of the queries we will utilize include:

- Life Expectancy
- Education
- Demographic Breakdown
