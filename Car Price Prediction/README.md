# Car Price Prediction using Regression

## Description

**Skill(s): Machine Learning, EDA, Data Visualization**

This project utilizes Pandas for in-depth exploration and analysis of a car dataset, focusing on extracting meaningful insights from the distribution of car attributes and trends within the data. Through data cleaning, transformation, and visualizations, key patterns are identified to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing car prices. Finally, Lasso regression is applied as a machine learning model to predict the price of used cars, leveraging features such as the carâ€™s model, manufacturer, year, and mileage. This combination of data analysis and predictive modeling provides valuable insights for decision-making in the used car market.
